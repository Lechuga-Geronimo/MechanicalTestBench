## Abstract. 

One of the objectives of the [REDACTED] is to generate institutional and national capacities in the field of space technology development. To this end, and aligning with the National Plan for Space Activities, the primary objective is to assimilate nano-satellite technology, particularly those built on the CubeSat standard, for the construction of satellites that are 100% Mexican.

One of the most stringent requirements is the CubeSat testing phase, which consists of thermo-vacuum tests and mechanical vibration tests. The objective of the latter is to demonstrate that the primary structure, the satellite subsystems as well as the electronic and mechanical components can resist the mechanical vibrations that the satellite will experience during its transport in a rocket, launch, deployment and subsequent operation, thus ensuring that it will comply with its Space mission. These tests have three levels of strictness: prototype, proto-flight and acceptance, and there are various standards for their implementation, such as the NASA GEVS GSFC-STD-7000 A standard. Thus, the particular characteristics of these tests make it necessary for test banks to Vibration testing for these purposes has very specialized requirements.

In this way, and considering that certified vibration tests for CubeSats are only carried out by companies or space agencies from first world countries, it is essential that Mexico and the [REDACTED] develop their own validation technology for satellite structures built in Mexico. This project proposes the design, manufacture and validation of the mechanical structure of a sinusoidal, random and mechanical shock mechanical vibration test bench, which supports the performance of cyclic and redundant tests at the prototype level according to the restrictive GSFC standard. STD-7000 A.
